//! The dictation pipeline: hotkey → microphone → speech-to-text → paste.
//!
//! Threads (none of them is the UI thread, and nothing blocks the hook thread):
//! - `hotkey` (agt-platform): low-level keyboard hook watching every configured hotkey, one
//!   hold at a time; forwards hold events (with which hotkey went down) to `audio`.
//! - `audio`: owns the microphone. Starts recording when any hotkey goes down, and on its
//!   release hands the samples to `stt`. Short taps and cancelled holds are dropped here.
//!   While recording it also polls the held hotkey's keys, in case the hook missed the
//!   release (see [`RELEASE_POLL`]), and takes the new audio: a long recording is cut into
//!   segments as it comes in (`agt_stt::chunk::Live`, cheap), and each finished one goes to
//!   `stt` right away, so at release only the last few seconds are left to transcribe (see
//!   [`Feed`]). A double tap (`hotkey.double_tap_ms`; the two taps may be on different
//!   hotkeys) records hands-free instead: the release doesn't end that recording, the next
//!   press and release of any hotkey does (Esc cancels it, and so does [`HANDS_FREE_MAX`]).
//!   After a tap the status stays "recording" for `double_tap_ms`, so the bar doesn't flicker
//!   between the two taps.
//! - `duck` (agt-platform, with `audio.duck`): once the microphone has started, turns the
//!   system output volume down until the recording ends, however it ends. Not while a meeting
//!   records ([`Pipeline::set_meeting_active`]): that would turn the call down.
//! - `stt`: downloads/loads the model at start-up, then transcribes jobs in order. A new
//!   recording may start while the previous one is still being transcribed: jobs queue up
//!   and are pasted in order (nothing is dropped). A recording's segments are transcribed
//!   while it's still being recorded, and their texts joined at release; a dropped
//!   (cancelled) recording's are skipped, or discarded if already being transcribed.
//!   It also transcribes a recording meeting's segments ([`Pipeline::transcriber`]) on the same
//!   engine, at low priority: each time it takes everything queued, and whatever dictation sent
//!   (segments cut while recording, the job at release, a dropped recording's record, a
//!   reload) goes first, in the order sent ([`SttQueue`]). So a meeting delays a dictation by
//!   at most the one meeting segment already being transcribed when the dictation's work came
//!   in. Meeting segments never reach polish, the paste, history or the status line.
//! - `polish`: with `polish.enabled`, cleans each transcript up with an LLM (`agt-polish`),
//!   bounded by `polish.timeout_ms`; on any failure the transcript is kept. Then applies the
//!   dictionary's replacements (`dictionary.toml`, see [`agt_core::dictionary`]) to that
//!   text, polish on or off, so polish never rewrites them, and hands it to `paste`. A long
//!   dictation transcribed while recording is also polished while recording, in pieces that
//!   end at a sentence end (`agt_polish::ahead`, local servers only), so at release only the
//!   rest is left to polish (see [`Partial::feed_ahead`]). The replacements are made once the
//!   pieces are joined, so a phrase is never split across segments or pieces.
//! - `permissions` (macOS, only while something is missing): asks for the Microphone and
//!   Accessibility permissions at start-up, then re-checks every [`PERMISSION_POLL`] until
//!   both are granted, so no restart is needed.
//! - `paste`: saves the clipboard when a recording starts (on a helper thread, with a
//!   deadline, so a hung clipboard owner can't block pasting), pastes, and restores the
//!   clipboard `paste.restore_clipboard_ms` later. If that save is what keeps the clipboard
//!   busy, the paste waits for it (up to [`BUSY_SAVE_WAIT`]). It also waits while a key of any
//!   hotkey that the paste would disturb is still held (see [`HOTKEY_RELEASE_POLL`]). It keeps
//!   the last transcript in memory for the tray's "Copy last transcript".
//!
//! Status changes are reported through a callback (the app forwards them to the tray and the
//! overlay).
//!
//! Each dictation's measurements travel with it as an [`agt_telemetry::Dictation`] and are
//! recorded (a channel send, never a disk write) wherever it ends: after the paste, or at the
//! stage that dropped it. Only counts and timings: never the audio or the text. Meeting
//! segments get no such record.
//!
//! With `[history]` on, a transcribed dictation's text and/or audio also travel with it, as an
//! [`agt_history::Entry`], and are handed to the history writer (again a channel send) after
//! the paste. With it off, no entry is built. Its `raw` text is the engine's, before the
//! dictionary's replacements.
//!
//! The dictionary in use is swapped as a whole when `dictionary.toml` changes
//! ([`Pipeline::set_dictionary`]); no restart. Each dictation keeps the one in use at its
//! key-down, for the engine's hints and all its replacements (see [`Words`]).
