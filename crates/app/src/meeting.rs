//! Meeting notes in the app: owns the recording [`Session`], the meeting folders' [`Store`],
//! the AI notes jobs and the "Meeting detected" prompt, and tells the windows
//! ([`crate::meeting_ui`]) what to show. Everything here runs on the UI thread; the session,
//! the summary jobs, the start and the detection poll post back as [`Msg`].
//!
//! - **One meeting at a time**, from the tray, the pill, the notes window or the command line
//!   ([`crate::control`]). A start from the tray also opens the notes window on it; the others
//!   don't (an open notes window switches to it). [`Session::start`] opens both captures, which
//!   can take a moment, so it runs on a `meeting-start` thread.
//! - While a meeting records or finishes, dictation doesn't duck the volume
//!   ([`Pipeline::set_meeting_active`]), the meeting's mic track is silence while a dictation
//!   records ([`Pipeline::dictating`]), and AGT never restarts for new settings or an update
//!   ([`Meetings::busy`], which counts AI notes being written too). Quitting stops it and waits
//!   for its last lines, and gives AI notes a few seconds ([`Meetings::shutdown`]).
//! - **AI notes** run the user's Claude Code CLI on a `meeting-summary` thread
//!   ([`summary::run`]): when the user clicks Generate notes, and with `meeting.auto_summary`
//!   on, by themselves after a stop when the transcript has [`AUTO_SUMMARY_WORDS`]
//!   ([`auto_summary`]). The notes page always gets an answer, done or the reason why not.
//!   That is the only time text leaves the machine.
//! - **What goes wrong reaches the user**: a session's errors and a start that failed (or was
//!   refused: the speech model didn't load) go to the notes page as a one-line notice, and
//!   flash the pill ([`Meetings::notice`]). The last notice per meeting is kept and given to a
//!   notes window that opens later ([`Notices`]). A start that fails from the tray or the
//!   pill's Take notes opens the notes window, on the list, to say why. "Speech model still
//!   loading" goes away once it has loaded.
//! - **Meetings AGT never got to stop** (it was killed or crashed) are put right once at
//!   launch, on a `meeting-recover` thread ([`Store::recover`]).
//! - **Detection** (`meeting.detect`, macOS): a `meeting-detect` thread lists the apps using
//!   the microphone every [`DETECT_POLL`] while no meeting records; [`Detector`] decides when
//!   the pill offers to take notes.
