//! The meeting notes windows: the side pill and the notes window, two web pages
//! (`ui/pill.html`, `ui/notes.html`, embedded) in the system webview (wry: WKWebView on macOS,
//! WebView2 on Windows), and the messages both ways (the IPC contract in the meeting notes
//! design). [`crate::meeting`] decides what they show; this module only shows it. Everything
//! here runs on the UI thread.
//!
//! - Pages post JSON with `window.ipc.postMessage`; the handlers parse it ([`FromNotes`],
//!   [`FromPill`]) and post it to the event loop. Rust answers with `window.agt.receive(msg)`
//!   ([`ToNotes`], [`ToPill`]) through `evaluate_script`. Until a page has loaded, what it
//!   would get is queued (levels are dropped).
//! - The pill never takes focus: on macOS a non-activating `NSPanel` (like the dictation
//!   overlay) shown with `orderFrontRegardless`, on Windows a `WS_EX_NOACTIVATE` tool window
//!   shown with `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`. Clicking it doesn't activate AGT either, so the call app
//!   keeps the keyboard. It is left out of screen sharing and recordings (macOS
//!   `sharingType = none`, Windows `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`), floats above other windows and
//!   (macOS) joins every Space, full-screen ones included.
//! - Hover and drag are Rust's job: WKWebView may not report the mouse entering a window of an
//!   app that isn't active, and a native drag started from an asynchronous message can miss
//!   its mouse-down. So while the pill shows, a timer ([`TICK`], about 15 times a second, in
//!   the event loop's `WaitUntil`: no thread, no busy loop) reads the global cursor position
//!   and decides whether the pill is expanded ([`Hover`]); after the page's `drag` it follows
//!   the cursor vertically, at [`DRAG_TICK`], while the primary button stays down. The same
//!   timer sends the levels. While the pill is hidden nothing runs.
//! - The notes window is a normal window, created on first use. Closing it hides it (after
//!   `window.agt.flush()`, so an edit still waiting for its autosave is sent): the page keeps
//!   its state, and opening it again is instant. On macOS AGT then gives the focus back to the
//!   app before it, as closing an app's last window would.
//! - Each webview shows its page and nothing else ([`own_page`]): no navigation away (a URL or
//!   file dropped outside a text field would otherwise replace the page, which wry gives
//!   `window.ipc` too, and keep getting the transcript), no new windows, and IPC only from the
//!   page itself. Text dropped into the notes editor still lands there. macOS loads the pages
//!   with `with_html`; Windows serves them on a custom protocol ([`SERVED`]).
