# Hold a hotkey to dictate, let go to paste. Nearly any key can be one (not Esc, nor Caps
# Lock on macOS or Pause on Windows), by its name in one word: F13, A, Space, Slash,
# LeftShift, RightOption or LeftCommand (macOS), RightCtrl, RightAlt or LeftWin (Windows)...
# Pressing a key that isn't a modifier while holding a hotkey (e.g. Esc) cancels.
# Or a combo of up to 4 keys held together, at most one of them not a modifier, e.g.
# "LeftCtrl+LeftWin" (the default on Windows) or "LeftControl+Space" (macOS). A combo of only
# modifiers starts once all are down, in any order. With a key that isn't a modifier, it
# starts only when exactly its modifiers are held, pressed before that key, and only then is
# that key kept from the app. A combo ends when any of its keys is released.
# Several hotkeys can be listed, and any of them dictates: key = ["Fn", "LeftControl+Space"]
# on macOS, or ["LeftCtrl+LeftWin", "F13"] on Windows. They can share keys, but one can't
# contain another (LeftShift and LeftShift+Space). In the Settings window you set them by
# pressing the keys.
# Alone, a key that isn't a modifier is taken over: it won't type in other apps while AGT runs
# (F13-F24 cost nothing: they're usually spare mouse or keyboard buttons). A combo with one is
# taken over in every app too: with only Shift or Option (Windows: RightAlt, AltGr on many
# layouts) and a key that types (a letter, digit, Space, punctuation), it types a character;
# otherwise (other modifiers, or Tab, Enter, an arrow...) it's a shortcut apps won't see.
# Alone, a modifier you use in shortcuts and typing (either Shift; macOS: either Control,
# LeftOption, LeftCommand; Windows: LeftCtrl, either Alt, either Win) starts AGT listening
# each time you hold it, and a tap of Win or Alt alone no longer opens Start or an app's menu.
# macOS: Fn is the Globe key (the default; as a hotkey on its own, tapping it no longer also
# opens the emoji picker).
# With a key in a hotkey that pasting would let go of (macOS: LeftCommand or V; Windows:
# LeftCtrl, either Shift, either Alt or either Win), text is only pasted once those keys are
# up: if you already hold a hotkey for the next dictation, the previous text lands when you
